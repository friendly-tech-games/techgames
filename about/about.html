            This is currently a one person operation. I have had a passion for teaching, technology and board games and this my way of sharing that with the world. </br></br>
            In my day job as a cybersecurity architect I often have to explain complex technical topics in a way that is understandable to lovely folks that just do not have that background.
            I find that many people are often intiminated by these topics, and need some encouragment to build confidence. I believe anyone can learn anything with the right mindset. </br></br>
            Many people want to understand technology as it becomes more interwined in our lives as part of the modern world. The idea is if I can craft an experience about the concepts of technology in the format of cardboard that is something anyone can engage with.
